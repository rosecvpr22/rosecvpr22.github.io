# Overview
<div style="text-align: justify">
Most of the real-world data is sequential and there is always a distribution shift when we move from training set to real-world testing scenario. This workshop invites researchers from both academia and industry to advance the research in robust learning for real-world applications. The goal of this workshop is to explore the fundamental problems in the characterization of distribution shifts in sequential data and to develop robust models for sequential data for real-world applications.

<div style="text-align: justify">
<a href="http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~balaji/">Balaji Lakshminarayanan</a> is a staff research scientist at Google Brain in Mountain View (USA), working on Machine Learning and its applications. His research interests are in scalable, probabilistic machine learning. Dr. Lakshminarayanan’s PhD thesis was focused on exploring (and exploiting :) connections between neat mathematical ideas in (nonparametric) Bayesian land and computationally efficient tricks in decision tree land, to get the best of both worlds. More recently, he has focused on probabilistic deep learning: uncertainty and robustness in deep learning, out-of-distribution robustness of generative models, deep generative models including generative adversarial networks (GANs), normalizing flows and variational auto-encoders (VAEs), and applying probabilistic deep learning ideas in healthcare and Google products.
