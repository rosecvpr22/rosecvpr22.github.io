# Special Note: Recognizing Juneteenth at CVPR 2022
<div style="text-align: justify">
This year, June 19 and 20 marks Juneteenth, a US holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US, and a holiday of special significance in the US South. We encourage attendees to learn more about Juneteenth and its historical context, and to join the city of New Orleans in celebrating the Juneteenth holiday.

# Overview
<div style="text-align: justify">
Most of the real-world data is sequential and there is always a distribution shift when we move from training set to real-world testing scenario. This workshop invites researchers from both academia and industry to advance the research in robust learning for real-world applications. The goal of this workshop is to explore the fundamental problems in the characterization of distribution shifts in sequential data and to develop robust models for sequential data for real-world applications.

<a href="http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~balaji/">Balaji Lakshminarayanan</a> is a staff research scientist at Google Brain. His recent research is focused on probabilistic deep learning, specifically, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution robustness and applications.

He has co-organized several workshops on "Uncertainty and Robustness in deep learning" and served as Area Chair for NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR and AISTATS.
<br><b>Abstract:</b> Deep neural networks can make overconfident errors and assign high confidence predictions to inputs far away from the training data. Well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates are important to know when to trust a model's predictions, especially for safe deployment of models in applications where the train and test distributions can be different. I'll first present some concrete examples that motivate the need for uncertainty and out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness in deep learning. Next, I'll present an overview of our recent work focused on building neural networks that know what they don’t know: this includes methods which improve single model uncertainty (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10108">spectral-normalized neural Gaussian processes</a>), methods which average over multiple neural network predictions such as Bayesian neural nets and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01474">deep ensembles</a>, and methods that leverage better representations (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03004">improving “near-OOD” detection</a>).
