# Robustness in Sequential Data
## CVPR 2022 workshop, June 2022, New Orleans, Louisiana

# Overview
<div style="text-align: justify">
Most of the real-world data is sequential and there is always a distribution shift when we move from training set to real-world testing scenario. This workshop invites researchers from both academia and industry to advance the research in robust learning for real-world applications. The goal of this workshop is to explore the fundamental problems in the characterization of distribution shifts in sequential data and to develop robust models for sequential data for real-world applications.
